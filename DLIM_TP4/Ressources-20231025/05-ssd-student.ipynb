    "\n",
    "* Single shot multibox detection is a multiscale object detection model. Via its base network and several multiscale feature map blocks, single-shot multibox detection generates a varying number of anchor boxes with different sizes, and detects varying-size objects by predicting classes and offsets of these anchor boxes (thus the bounding boxes).\n",

    "\n",
    "Can you improve the single-shot multibox detection by improving the loss function? For example, replace $\\ell_1$ norm loss with smooth $\\ell_1$ norm loss for the predicted offsets. This loss function uses a square function around zero for smoothness, which is controlled by the hyperparameter $\\sigma$:\n",
