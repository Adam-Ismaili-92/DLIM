    "\n",
    "* We generate anchor boxes with different shapes centered on each pixel of the image.\n",
    "* Intersection over union (IoU), also known as Jaccard index, measures the similarity of two bounding boxes. It is the ratio of their intersection area to their union area.\n",
    "* In a training set, we need two types of labels for each anchor box. One is the class of the object relevant to the anchor box and the other is the offset of the ground-truth bounding box relative to the anchor box.\n",
    "* During prediction, we can use non-maximum suppression (NMS) to remove similar predicted bounding boxes, thereby simplifying the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Change values of `sizes` and `ratios` in the `multibox_prior` function. What are the changes to the generated anchor boxes?\n",
    "1. Construct and visualize two bounding boxes with an IoU of 0.5. How do they overlap with each other?"
